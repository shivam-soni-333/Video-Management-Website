# Video Management Web Application

###### The topic for this project is one of the previously asked questions in rtcamp solutions and this question quite interests me so that's why I created this project to brush up my skills in PHP javascript. I love challenging works that push me to work hard and not give up. it always teaches me so many things while creating projects.

Video Encoding Challenge
This is more like building your own YouTube. ðŸŽ¥
Please create an interactive JavaScript/React app which has:

1.Upload: Option to upload video in any format. Since videos are large, the uploader should show progress.

2.Convert: On successful upload video, the server-side (PHP) process should encode video into mp4 format in the background. Basically, after the video upload is complete, a user will simply close the browser. But when they come back later they should see video available in multiple formats. You can use FFMPEG to encode videos.

3.Thumbnail: For videos that are successfully converted, display thumbnails like YouTube homepage shows. Once anyone hovers on thumbnails, a small GIF should play automatically so people can see the content of the video without watching the entire video.

4.Watermark: For uploaded video â€” a user can provide watermark text â€” give an option for the user to specify text â€” and use user-provided text to add that in the video as watermark.

```

## My Solution :-

1.Upload Functionality :- <br>
  -> it mentioned that video is large and we need to show progress so that's why i choose javascript to do this work since we can use XMLHttpRequest object for upload and also we can know upload size and progress of upload.
